><i> Hi! I'm Maureen Repollo. My hobbies are playing badminton, board games, and online games like mobile legeds.</i></em>
<i>I realyy love to play badminton but i never played when it comes to a contest .</i></em>
<i>I am afraid that someone will laugh at me and bully  me that i am not a good player. </i></em>
<i>So eventhough i love badminton i still dont want to play with it.</i></em>
<i>Also, I love to play board games. I won some on a contest but mostly i lost.</i></em>
<i>But i did'nt stop playing and participating on a contest </i></em>
<i>because i know that someday i will master this game and won more contest.</i></em>
<i>And as i love the most.I love to play Mobile Legands. When i have free time i played mobile legends.</i></em>
<i>I love playing it because i gained so much friends with this game.</i></em>
<i>My mother always told me that playing is not that  bad but being addicted with the game is a bad thing.</i></em>
<i>As a Filipino we have the saying that " Lahat ng sobra ay nakakasama" So i always control my self</i></em>
<i>when most of my time is wasted on online games i always remind my self that "Lahat ng sobra ay nakakasama"</i></em>
<i>Those are my hobbies but i'm not a pro i'm just a player. Just a reminder it's okay to play. It's okay if you want to master a game. </i></em>
<i>But don't forget that your hobbies should make you more healty and a good person. Try to observe yourself when you think </i></em>
<i>your hobbies are still making good thing to you then maintain it. But when you observe that your hobbies are making you worst</i></em>
<i>then stop it. Make yourself more better, manage your time well, and make yourself more productive not addictive.</i></em>
